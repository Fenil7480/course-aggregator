            <p>
              Web3 can be defined as the decentralized and blockchain-based
              version of the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually the foundations of the idea were laid in 2014, but today
              it has come to the fore with the popularization of
              cryptocurrencies.

              Can Web3 really decentralize the internet?
            </AccordionItemButton>
          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
              It&apos;s possible that getting regulated to compete against big tech
              companies, or to make those companies more accountable for
              mistakes, could make the internet better. In this context, a
              decentralized network is a tangible plus.
            </p>
            <p>
              For artists, musicians, and other creators, it&apos;s also possible
              that a direct-consumer relationship is actually better than, for
              example, Spotify, which has been criticized for not paying artists
              enough. Similar issues exist with Instagram and Reddit, both hubs
              where artwork is shared without attribution or payment to the
              artist, or TikTok, where black creators do not receive royalties
              for their dances.

          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
            All sprint projects are graded as pass/fail. When you are ready to test your sprint project, you will zip all of the necessary test files and upload them to our automated code grader. With a fast internet connection, auto-grading will take a few minutes to let you know if your project was successful or not. You may complete and submit each sprint project as many times as you need to master the skills and achieve a passing score.

            </p>
            <p>
            To receive a certification of course completion, you must achieve a passing score on every project and complete all 10 sprints.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you submit a sprint project, the next sprint will be unlocked, whether or not your project passed. In this way, you may work through our Web3 course without passing every sprintâ€”but not receive a certification of course completion.
